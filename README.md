Data Mining Project--- Time Series Forecasting of the Concentration of Air Pollutants in Delhi Using Neural Network and ARIMA Modelling

This repository deals with the significance of stochastic modeling technique in forecasting of possible concentration
of various pollutants present in the air. The ITO square in New Delhi, the capital of India is the site of analysis. 
For the study, the dataset has been collected from CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) for the period of nine years 
i.e from 2007 to 2015. In this repository, codes for a Feed-forward neural network with a single hidden layer and a
seasonal ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model which is applied for forecasting of particulate matter
(PM10 and PM2.5),Carbon monoxide, oxides of sulphur and Nitrogen and Ozone, using the Forecast Package of R. R-square, 
R-square, Root Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error are studied for pollutants. 
The codes forecasts concentration of pollutants for the year 2016 from the previous data of 2007 to 2015. Suitable results have 
been obtained using the codes and then compared to find which generally reveals its application and signifying its use as a 
modeling technique for determining the future values of concentration of pollutants and its usein different areas.
